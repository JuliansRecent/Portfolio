			<p class="brand-statement">
				Coming from the medical field, with attention to detail, and a creative
				mind. I strive to help build innovative technologies for the future. I
				love working with others to bring a common goal together and I bring
				this to my work as a software engineer.

            <br>
			<p class="brand-statement">
				Just to tell you a little about myself, I’m originally from Fresno,
				California and I was home-schooled for the last 2 years of highschool to
				play competitive golf. I really loved the sense of community that you
				get at a golf course and on a golf team, and almost decided to play golf
				on a college golf team, but I also had ambitions to become a doctor. I
				couldn’t do both due to the time requirements they require, so I decided
				to go the doctor route. Shortly after enrolling as a biology major, I
				earned a position as a medical scribe, documenting patients charts
				alongside doctors. This position taught me a lot about having attention
				to detail, and maintaining professionalism while building relationships
				with team members, but after getting to know a lot of my doctor
				co-workers they disclosed that the medical system was being overtaken by
				corporations and was no longer for the people. This along with other
				negative traits shown in the medical field drew me to chase a position
				with more freedom, and better culture like the one I found in the
				golfing community. This led me to software engineering. It allows me to
				work in an amazing community of people, while still doing meaningful
				work, with freedom to do other things I love, which is what I strive
				for.
