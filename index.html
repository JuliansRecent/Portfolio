			<p class="brand-statement">
				Coming from the medical field, with attention to detail, and a creative
				mind. I strive to help build innovative technologies for the future. I
				love working with others to bring a common goal together and I bring
				this to my work as a software engineer.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p class="brand-statement">
				I’m originally from Fresno, California and I was home-schooled for the
				last 2 years of highschool to play competitive golf. I really loved the
				sense of community that you get at a golf course and on a golf team, and
				almost decided to play golf on a college golf team, but I also had
				ambitions to become a doctor. I couldn’t do both due to the time
				requirements they require, so I decided to go the doctor route. Shortly
				after enrolling as a biology major, I earned a position as a medical
				scribe, documenting patients charts alongside doctors. This position
				taught me a lot about having attention to detail, and maintaining
				professionalism while building relationships with team members, but
				after getting to know a lot of my doctor co-workers they disclosed that
				the medical system was being overtaken by corporations and was no longer
				for the people. This along with other negative traits shown in the
				medical field drew me to chase a position with more freedom, and better
				culture like the one I found in the golfing community. This led me to
				software engineering. It allows me to work in an amazing community of
				people, while still doing meaningful work, with freedom to do other
				things I love, which is what I strive for.
